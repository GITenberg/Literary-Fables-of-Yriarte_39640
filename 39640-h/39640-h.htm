<p>I do not flatter myself that it will make any conspicuous
addition to the worthy achievements that have already graced
our roll with names that rank high in the lists of Science,
Philosophy and Literature. But it is pleasant to me to
connect this translation of a college text-book&mdash;used by us
all, long ago, within the walls of old Harvard&mdash;with the
memory of youthful pursuits that have never lost their charm
for the mind, and early associations that retain, with all
their original freshness and geniality, their hold upon the
heart.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h3>


<p>The Fable has always been a popular mode of conveying
certain kinds of instruction. The brief and simple
illustrations it affords give additional weight and point to
moral apothegms or sententious criticisms. Like the feather
on the shaft, they serve to increase the force and direct
the aim more certainly to the mark. A pertinent fact or an
apt fiction breathes, even into a dry and curt axiom, a
living and practical interest which opens to it hearts and
heads that would otherwise pass it by with indifference, or
revolt from it with impatience. Many of these unpretending
allegories have been familiar to us all, in childhood, in a
great variety of dresses, and have long formed a standard
part of our literature &mdash;congenial alike to nursery days and
to mature age.</p>

<p>The fables contained in the little collection here
translated are not, with one or two exceptions, found among
the widely popular and familiar fables to which we have
alluded. They were written in a foreign tongue, less
generally understood, among us, than some other of the
European languages; and they are designed for a special and
somewhat abstruse purpose. Both these circumstances tend to
narrow their sphere of circulation; and we presume that
they form a book little known to most English readers.</p>

<p>If we do not err in our estimate of them, the Literary
Fables of Don Thomas De Yriarte are well worthy of perusal.
They are aptly and ingeniously adapted to the truths they
seek to inculcate; and they are remarkable for a terse
simplicity of form and style, well suited to the objects and
character of such productions. The maxims and criticisms
they enforce must approve themselves to the mind, both of
the professed scholar and the general reader.</p>

<p>The author was born in Teneriffe, A.D. 1750, but was
educated and resided at Madrid, where he died in 1791, at
the early age, of course, of forty-one years. His uncle, Don
Juan De Yriarte, was the chief superintendent of the royal
library; and the nephew was educated under his auspices. In
his eighteenth year, he commenced his literary career by the
writing of dramas, and the translation of plays from the
French for the Spanish stage. He spent his life in the
duties of sundry offices under the government; yet he very
soon assumed and maintained a high consideration as a
scholar and writer. His works, however, were of a character
to command but little interest from posterity, with the
exception of the fables translated in this little volume.</p>

<p>Of them, Professor Ticknor, from whose learned work on
Spanish literature we have collected these details, speaks
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, he, in some degree, struck out a new path; for he not
only invented all his fictions, which no other fabulist, in
modern times, had done, but restricted them all, in their
moral purpose, to the correction of the faults and follies
of men of learning&mdash;an application which had not before been
thought of. They are written with great care, in no less
than forty different measures, and show an extraordinary
degree of ingenuity in adapting the attributes and instincts
of animals to the instruction, not of mankind at large, as
had always been done before, but to that of a separate and
small class, between whom and the inferior creation the
resemblance is rarely obvious. The task was certainly a
difficult one. Perhaps, on this account, they are too
narrative in their structure, and fail somewhat in the
genial spirit which distinguishes Esop and La Fontaine, the
greatest masters of Apologue and Fable. But their influence
was so needed in the age of bad writing when they appeared,
and they are, besides, so graceful in their versification,
that they were not only received with great favor at first,
but have never lost it since."&mdash;<i>Ticknor's Hist, of Span.
Literature</i>, vol. iii., p. 279.</p>

<p>We have endeavored to discharge with fidelity the duty of
translation; attempting to preserve the form and spirit of
the author, as far as was consistent with giving the work an
English dress. With this view, we have aimed to produce a
literal and characteristic reflection of the original rather
than an expanded and highly-wrought paraphrase. Where we
could do so, we have sought to preserve the metre, or a
nearly analogous one, in order, if possible, to give a clear
idea of the Spanish work to the English reader. But this is
not practicable in all cases. The peculiar construction of
Spanish rhymes, together with the obstinacy with which some
words and sentences refuse the stern yoke of our English
rules, render the task, always hard, sometimes impossible.
The terminal inflections of the Spanish language and its
accentuation are widely different from those of the
Anglo-Saxon; and so axe the arbitrary arrangements of the
rhythm, which are, in the latter, far more exacting and
precise. The professed scholar will recognize and make due
allowance for such obstacles. To the public at large we
shall hope our little book may convey some instruction and
amusement, in a palatable shape. If so, it may give, to a
novel class of subjects, somewhat of the well-known interest
inspired by the graceful and popular fictions of Esop, Gay
and La Fontaine.</p>

<h4>THE ELEPHANT AND OTHER ANIMALS</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 35%;">
Long years ago, in far-off land,<br />
When every brute beast had a way,<br />
What he thought and felt, to say<br />
In language all could understand&mdash;<br />
The sagacious Elephant observed<br />
Among these creatures many a failing,<br />
And gross abuses, too, prevailing,<br />
Which strenuous reform deserved.<br />
He called them all, from far and near,<br />
His strictures on their ways to hear.<br />
With reverence the most profound<br />
His long proboscis swept the ground;<br />
In careful phrase, well learned by heart,<br />
He then discharged the censor's part&mdash;<br />
A thousand silly foibles noted,<br />
A thousand vicious actions quoted;<br />
Envy, working sore vexation,<br />
Ostentatious insolence,<br />
Idleness, procrastination,<br />
The arrogance of ignorance.<br />
<br />
His sound and noble counsel stirs<br />
The hearts of many listeners,<br />
Accepting, with due reverence,<br />
The dictates of his generous sense.<br />
The guileless Lamb and thrifty Ant,<br />
The Bee, frugal and provident,<br />
The trusty Setter, and the Dove,<br />
Ever faithful to her love,<br />
The obedient Horse, the Linnet shy,<br />
And the simple Butterfly.<br />
But, of the audience, a part not small<br />
Declared that their offended pride<br />
Such language plain could not abide;<br />
Not they&mdash;no, not at all.<br />
The Tiger and rapacious Wolf,<br />
Opening their lank jaws' bloody gulf,<br />
Against the adviser rave;<br />
His vile abuse, among the crowd,<br />
The venomous Serpent hissed aloud;<br />
While, all around, the whispering tone<br />
Of Wasp and Hornet, Fly and Drone,<br />
A murmuring echo gave.<br />
The mischievous Balm-cricket leapt<br />
From the tumultuous throng;<br />
The Locust spread his clanging wing,<br />
His greedy conscience felt the sting;<br />
The wriggling Caterpillar crept<br />
His sneaking way along;<br />
The Weasel arched his spiteful back;<br />
The Fox kept silence shrewd;<br />
The Monkey, sauciest of the pack,<br />
Mocked, with grimaces rude.<br />
<br />
The stately Elephant looked down<br />
Upon the vexed turmoil:<br />
"To each and all and yet to none,"&mdash;<br />
Spake his calm voice above the broil,&mdash;<br />
"These censures I apply;<br />
Let him who winces put them on;<br />
Who not, hear quietly."<br />

Whoever may my fables read,<br />
This truth important let him heed:<br />
That to all nations&mdash;not to any one&mdash;<br />
And to all times, they speak.<br />
The world has shown alike<br />

In each revolving week.<br />
Then&mdash;since the warning finger<br />
Points at no destined head&mdash;<br />

Must sup on his own bread.<br />

<h4>THE SILKWORM AND SPIDER.</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
At his cocoon a busy Silkworm labored;<br />
A Spider, who with all her might was spinning<br />
Hard by, with laugh malicious, thus bespoke him.<br />
In silly exultation tasks comparing:<br />
"What think you of my web, good Master Silkworm?<br />
This very morning I began it, early,<br />
And now, mid-day will see the job completed.<br />
Just see how fine and beautiful it is, too!"<br />
Coolly replied the precious fabric's workman:<br />
"'T is true&mdash;your labor tells us its own story."<br />

<h4>THE BEAR, THE MONKEY AND THE HOG.</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
A Piedmontese a Bear had taught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon two legs the art of dancing;</span><br />
To earn their bread, the master sought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By showing off his awkward prancing.</span><br />
<br />
Now, Bruin, anxious to excel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the Monkey showed his skill.</span><br />
"How do I dance, friend? Prithee tell."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ill," said the Monkey, "very ill."</span><br />
<br />
"I am afraid you look on me,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Bruin, "with a jealous eye.</span><br />
Now, that I move quite gracefully,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And know the step, can you deny?"</span><br />
<br />
A jolly Pig was standing by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shouted,&mdash;"Bravo! nobly done!</span><br />
A better dancer, sure am I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was never seen beneath the sun."</span><br />
<br />
He spoke. But Bruin thoughtful stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soberly the grunter eyed;</span><br />
At last, in sad and humble mood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his loud praise he thus replied:</span><br />
<br />
"When Monkey did my dancing slight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I did not much the censure heed;</span><br />
But now I see, by your delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It must be miserable, indeed."</span><br />

<h4>THE DRONES AND THE BEE.</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
By a sense of their bad reputation molested,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Drones in grave council assembled one day;</span><br />
And various measures each idler suggested,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wash of their sloth the sad stigma away.</span><br />
<br />
No other expedient well could they see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the eyes of all animals better to stand&mdash;</span><br />
Though lazy and stupid as well they could be&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than to try, at the making of honey, their hand.</span><br />
<br />
But the labor proved very distasteful, indeed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The workmen, a rude, inexperienced crew;</span><br />
They began to be doubtful if they should succeed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Very well in attaining the object in view.</span><br />
<br />
To get rid of their trouble they fain would contrive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By interring in state an old Bee that had died&mdash;</span><br />
A notable Bee of a neighboring hive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all her companions the model and pride.</span><br />
<br />
With pomp and with honor they lauded her name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In funeral obsequies, brilliant and grand;</span><br />
Panegyrics immortal they buzzed to her fame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the whitest of wax and honey so bland.</span><br />
<br />
This done, with much self-satisfaction they stop.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a Bee said in scorn, "Is this all you can do?</span><br />
Of the honey I make, not one single drop<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would I give for the fuss of your beggarly crew."</span><br />

A dame from St. Domingo<br />
Brought with her Parrots twain.<br />
Now this island is half Gallic,<br />
Half owns the flag of Spain;<br />
Thus, in two different languages,<br />
The Parrots talked amain,<br />
Till the gallery where their cages hung<br />
Discordant was as Babylon.<br />
Soon the French and the Castilian<br />
They mixed up in such a bother<br />
That, in the end, no soul could tell<br />
If it were one or 't other.<br />
The French Parrot from the Spaniard<br />
Took a contribution small;<br />
While the Spanish bird changed nigh each word<br />
For the idiom of Gaul.<br />
<br />
Their mistress parts the babblers&mdash;<br />
And the Frenchman kept not long<br />
The phrases he had borrowed<br />
From less fashionable tongue.<br />
The other still refuses<br />
His jargon to give over;<br />
But new merit rather chooses<br />
In this hotchpotch to discover&mdash;<br />
Exulting that he thus can vary<br />
The range of his vocabulary.<br />
<br />
In mongrel French, one day,<br />
He eagerly begged after<br />
The scrapings of the pot;<br />
With hearty roar of laughter,<br />
From balcony across the way,<br />
A Magpie shouted out<br />
At the folly of the lout.<br />
<br />
The Parrot answered pertly,<br />
As with argument conclusive,&mdash;<br />
"You are nothing but a Purist,<br />
Of taste foolishly exclusive."&mdash;?<br />

That authentic author, Father Valdecebro,&mdash;<br />
In his veracious Natural History,<br />
Who exercised his warm imagination,<br />
By spots and marks, each beast minutely painting,<br />
And told, in style so fanciful and turgid,<br />
About the Unicorn astounding marvels,<br />
And to the fabulous Phoenix gave full credence,&mdash;<br />
In his eighth book, or ninth,&mdash;which I've forgotten,&mdash;<br />
Relates the story of a famous Monkey.<br />

The story ran: That it was a Monkey skilful<br />
In thousand tricks, who served a puppet showman:<br />
That thought one day, in absence of his master,<br />
To ask some beasts&mdash;his own especial cronies&mdash;<br />
To witness all his entertaining juggles.<br />

An exhibition with the magic lanthorn<br />

In vain, for none could see the brilliant wonders<br />
Which Monkey was so volubly announcing.<br />
<br />
All were perplexed, and soon arose suspicion<br />
That these proceedings were but empty humbug.<br />
The Monkey, most of all, was disconcerted;<br />
When Master Pedro, entering unexpected,<br />
And,&mdash;what was going on at once perceiving,&mdash;<br />
Half laughing and half angry, said to Monkey,<br />
"What is the use of all your endless gabble,<br />
You fool, if you forget to light your lanthorn?"<br />

In a certain cathedral a huge bell there hung,<br />
That only on solemn occasions was rung;<br />
Its echoes majestic, by strokes three or four,<br />
Now and then, in grave cadence, were heard&mdash;never more.<br />
For this stately reserve and its wonderful weight,<br />
Throughout the whole parish, its glory was great.<br />
<br />
In the district the city held under its sway,<br />
Of a few wretched rustics, a hamlet there lay;<br />
And a poor little church, with a belfry so small,<br />
That you hardly would call it a belfry at all.<br />
There a little cracked cow-bell, that in it was swinging,<br />
For the poor little neighborhood did all the ringing.<br />
<br />
Now that this little belfry might ape in renown<br />
The cathedral's huge tower, that loomed up o'er the town;<br />
That briefly and seldom&mdash;on festivals noted&mdash;<br />
The said little bell should be rung&mdash;it was voted.<br />
By this cunning device, in their rustical eyes,<br />
Its tinkle soon passed for a bell of great size.<br />

A curious affectation some put on<br />
Of knowing everything they chance upon.<br />
Whatever matter they may hear or see,<br />

Of small account and easy always deem it,<br />

Sure as I live, to show them up in rhyme,<br />

The wholesome lesson of her industry;<br />
How, by her labor, her support she gains;<br />
How builds the ant-hills; with what care and pains<br />
She gathers up the scattered grains for food;<br />
And how all labor for the common good;<br />
With other instances of enterprise,<br />
That might with many pass for idle lies,<br />
If 't were not every day before our eyes.<br />
<br />
To all her statements still the Flea demurred,&mdash;<br />
Yet could not contradict a single word&mdash;<br />
With talk like this: "Ah, yes, undoubtedly;<br />
I grant it; certainly. O, so I see!<br />
'T is plain. I think so, too, myself. Of course.<br />
All right. I understand. There's better and there worse."<br />
<br />
With such evasions, patience growing thin,<br />
Ready almost to jump out of her skin,<br />
Unto the Flea she answered,&mdash;"Now, my friend,<br />
To go with me, I beg you, condescend.<br />
And since, in such grand fashion, you assume<br />
All this so mighty easy to be done,<br />
Give us yourself, by way of good example,<br />
Of your own great abilities, a sample."<br />

<h4>THE EGGS.</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
Beyond the sunny Philippines<br />
An island lies, whose name I do not know;<br />
But that's of little consequence, if so<br />
You understand that there they had no hens;<br />
Till, by a happy chance, a traveller,<br />
After a while, carried some poultry there.<br />
Fast they increased as any one could wish;<br />
Until fresh eggs became the common dish.<br />
But all the natives ate them boiled,&mdash;they say,&mdash;<br />
Because the stranger taught no other way.<br />
At last the experiment by one was tried&mdash;<br />
Sagacious man!&mdash;of having his eggs fried.<br />
And, O! what boundless honors, for his pains,<br />
His fruitful and inventive fancy gains!<br />
Another, now, to have them baked devised,&mdash;<br />
Most happy thought!&mdash;and still another, spiced.<br />
Who ever thought eggs were so delicate!<br />
Next, some one gave his friends an omelette:<br />
"Ah!" all exclaimed, "what an ingenious feat!"<br />
<br />
But scarce a year went by, an artiste shouts,<br />
"I have it now,&mdash;ye 're all a pack of louts!&mdash;<br />
With nice tomatoes all my eggs are stewed."<br />
And the whole island thought the mode so good,<br />
That they would so have cooked them to this day,<br />
But that a stranger, wandering out that way,<br />
Another dish the gaping natives taught,<br />
And showed them eggs cooked <i>à la Huguenot</i>.<br />
<br />
Successive cooks thus proved their skill diverse;<br />
But how shall I be able to rehearse<br />
All of the new, delicious condiments<br />
That luxury, from time to time, invents?<br />
Soft, hard and dropped; and now with sugar sweet,<br />
And now boiled up with milk, the eggs they eat;<br />
In sherbet, in preserves; at last they tickle<br />
Their palates fanciful with eggs in pickle.<br />
All had their day&mdash;the last was still the best.<br />
But a grave senior thus, one day, addressed<br />
The epicures: "Boast, ninnies, if you will,<br />
These countless prodigies of gastric skill&mdash;<br />
But blessings on the man who brought the hens!"<br />

<p style="margin-left: 35%;">
A Monkey, clothed in silk,<br />
Will a Monkey still remain;<br />
So says an ancient proverb,<br />
And so say I again;<br />
As to all, it clearly will appear,<br />
Who listen to our fable here.<br />
<br />
In dress of gaudy hues,<br />
Such as harlequin would choose,<br />
A Monkey tricked herself.<br />
But I rather think the elf<br />
From her master got her finery;<br />
For else, I hardly see<br />
How Monkey could or cloth or tailor find find&mdash;<br />
Yet so the story goes&mdash;but never mind.<br />
Seeing herself so gay,<br />
She through the window sprang<br />
Upon a roof that lay<br />
Below, then took her way<br />
Unto the far-off land of Tetuan.<br />
The proverb don't say this;<br />
But there a history is,<br />
Which I cannot call to mind,&mdash;<br />
For the book is very rare,&mdash;-<br />
Which doth the truth unravel<br />
Whither she did travel;<br />
Which to discover must have cost a world of care<br />
But the author does not say,<br />
And neither can I guess.<br />
If by ship, or by the way<br />
Of the Isthmus of Suez:<br />
All that we know is, that she certainly went there.<br />
Here our fine lady found<br />
A jolly Monkey crew,&mdash;<br />
For Monkeys there abound,&mdash;<br />
But naked every one:<br />
As no other style they knew<br />
In the land of Tetuan.<br />
Now the naked Monkeys crowd<br />
An admiring glance to snatch;<br />
Homage to pay they press;<br />
And readily allowed,<br />
To the brainless little wretch,<br />
Wisdom and wit to match<br />
The splendors of her dress.<br />
And forthwith it was decided,<br />
By general accord,<br />
That to her should be confided,<br />
As ruler of the horde,<br />
A meditated foray<br />
Far and wide about the land,<br />
A stock of food to gather<br />
To feed the hungry band.<br />
So the leader new set forth<br />
With all her subject host,<br />
And, not alone her road,<br />
But her wits as well, she lost.<br />
Over mountain, moor and valley,<br />
Forest, and ridge, and plain,<br />
Deserts, rivers and morasses,<br />
She dragged her wearied train.<br />
When the day's work was over<br />
They could scarcely move a limb;<br />
And each exhausted rover<br />
Decided&mdash;if again,<br />
Through his life, in such excursion<br />
It should be his luck to join&mdash;<br />
That he would choose a captain<br />
More skilled, if not so fine.<br />
From toil and from vexation,<br />
They learned a lesson bitter&mdash;<br />
That fine clothing is not wisdom,<br />
Not all things gold that glitter.<br />

And, when my task is done,<br />

While they eat all the meat.<br />

Wearily, wearily on,<br />
Day passes after day.<br />
In the house I will not stay,<br />
Nor in the hated town."<br />
<br />
The first chance of flight improving,<br />
He slily off did steal;<br />
Till he found, in a field, a wheel<br />
Of a well, which a Mule kept moving.<br />
<br />
As his eyes he on it set,<br />
He cried,&mdash;"What have we here?<br />
By this it would appear<br />
Here, too, they're roasting meat."<br />
<br />
"No meat I roast, but pump<br />
Water," replied the Mule.&mdash;<br />
"Let me, now, try a pull;<br />
I'm light, but up I'll jump.<br />

Ah! pretty heavy, is it?<br />
Something harder I must work.<br />
What then? I will not shirk;<br />

Who on naught else his hunger would assuage<br />

Her paws she ne'er could put upon a whisker.<br />
Of cunning traps no shrewd device,<br />
No arsenic hid in sweet confection,<br />
Nor any other bait or mixture,<br />
Ever prepared for rats or mice,<br />

But with whole pages nightly he made way.<br />

The rascal gnawed, moreover, nothing less,<br />
What our poor Author furnished to the presses,&mdash;<br />
His works of eloquence and poesy.<br />
And, as the manuscripts the accursed beast<br />
Had eaten once before, made he<br />
Of printed page still more luxurious feast.<br />

As heretofore with manuscript and print,<br />
The villanous vermin like destruction made.<br />

Corrosive sublimate, and writes<br />
Something; I know not whether verse or prose.<br />
'Tis eaten by the animal perverse,<br />
And quickly ends his sport.<br />
"Happy receipt which mischief sure requites!"<br />
Sarcastic said the Poet, thus relieved.<br />

Lest his malicious insult prove a snare;<br />
And the impatient wight he seeks to bait,<br />
Should write him in corrosive sublimate."<br />

Like musket balls.<br />

By such odd gear full sorely astounded, I rede,&mdash;<br />

<br />
This antick his patron, to quip him, devised&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Painter a guerdon to grant, to his gree&mdash;</span><br />
In a chest, as heir-loom from his ancestry prized,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some old coins had been lying for centuries three;</span><br />
Of the first of the Charles' and fifth Ferdinand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Philip the second and Philip the third:</span><br />
A purse full of these he placed in the hand<br />

Yon satin slashed doublet exchange for my coat,<br />

Not one, in the city's whole compass, there is<br />

Chambers, its walls did screen,<br />

In this odd predicament,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They, for friendly aid, accost</span><br />
A passing comrade of them both,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who his right arm had lost.</span><br />
<br />
The gestures of the mute<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He explained in language good;</span><br />
And the blind man, from his mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The whole matter understood.</span><br />
<br />
To close this curious scene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And conference singular,</span><br />

Just as of cash, and even of his life,<br />
At the sharp point of murderous knife,<br />
A luckless wayfarer to rob, he sought<br />
The Judge upbraids him with his crime&mdash;<br />
He answered: "Sir, from earliest time<br />
I've been a rogue, practised in petty theft;<br />
When buckles, watches, trunks and cloaks,<br />
And swords, I stole from other folks.<br />
Then, fairly launched upon my wild career,<br />
I houses sacked. Now&mdash;no compunction left&mdash;<br />

A knot of friends, invited to a feast,<br />
At table sat&mdash;a loitering guest,<br />
Who came long after all the rest,<br />
Sought for his tardiness to make excuse:<br />
And, by his comrades for a reason pressed,<br />
Drew out his Watch, and, holding it on high,<br />
Replied&mdash;"'Tis you are out of time, not I.<br />
'Tis two precisely&mdash;wherefore this abuse?"<br />

The rest of us came near an hour ago."<br />

I trust my Watch, as I have said before."<br />

Now let each wiser man this reference take<br />
To foolish authors, who gross blunders make;<br />
Then quote&mdash;in order to make good their stand&mdash;<br />
The first authority that comes to hand.<br />
<br />
But with our story we will now go on.<br />
The guests all round next eagerly began<br />
To pull their Watches out to test the fact,&mdash;<br />
For all men like to prove their words exact;&mdash;<br />
One at the quarter stood; at half, another;<br />
One made it six and thirty minutes past;<br />
This fourteen more, that ten less than the last.<br />
No single Watch agreed with any other.<br />
Then, all was doubt and question and vexation.<br />
By luck, their entertainer chanced to be<br />
A great proficient in astronomy.<br />
He, his Chronometer by observation<br />
Carefully set, consulted&mdash;and the hour<br />
Was three o'clock and just two minutes more.<br />
Thus he concluded all the disputation:<br />
"To quote opinion and authority<br />
Against the truth, if any one can see<br />
The use&mdash;no point needs unsupported be.<br />
For all can surely see, and must admit, forsooth,<br />
Many opinions there may be&mdash;but only one is truth!"<br />

Handsome or ugly, whether you be."<br />

Alas! how few of us authors live<br />
By the good advice the Owl doth give!<br />
All the nonsense we write, get printed we must;<br />
Although, to the world, it be dry as the dust.<br />

From Malaga unto Peralta,<br />
From the Canary Isles to Malta,<br />
From Valdepeñas to Oporto,<br />

To think that every cask of wine,<br />
Which on its head bears ancient date,<br />
By age will mellow and refine.<br />
Time cannot make the poor wine good;<br />
If mean it was, in its first hour,<br />
It will be washy still and crude,<br />
In nothing changed, but turning sour.<br />
Worth no jot more this hour, you know,<br />
Than vinegar a century ago.<br />
New wines, from time to time, there are,&mdash;<br />
Though some despise for being new,&mdash;<br />
Which very safely may compare<br />
With any wines that ever grew.<br />
Those you despise&mdash;although surpassed,<br />
Occasionally, in times long past,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
